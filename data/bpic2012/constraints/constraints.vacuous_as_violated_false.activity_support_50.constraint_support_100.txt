Activities:
1) A_PARTLYSUBMITTED : Exists in 100.00% of traces in the log
2) A_SUBMITTED : Exists in 100.00% of traces in the log
3) A_DECLINED : Exists in 58.34% of traces in the log
4) W_Completeren aanvraag : Exists in 56.29% of traces in the log
5) A_PREACCEPTED : Exists in 56.29% of traces in the log
Constraints:
1) In 100.00% of traces in the log, A_PARTLYSUBMITTED occurs exactly once
2) In 100.00% of traces in the log, A_SUBMITTED occurs exactly once
3) In 100.00% of traces in the log, A_DECLINED occurs at most once
4) In 100.00% of traces in the log, A_PREACCEPTED occurs at most once
5) In 100.00% of traces in the log, A_SUBMITTED and A_PARTLYSUBMITTED occur together if and only if the latter immediately follows the former
6) In 100.00% of traces in the log, A_SUBMITTED occurs first
7) In 100.00% of traces in the log, Each time A_PREACCEPTED occurs, then W_Completeren aanvraag occurs immediately afterwards
8) In 100.00% of traces in the log, Each time A_PREACCEPTED occurs, it is preceded by A_PARTLYSUBMITTED and no other A_PREACCEPTED can recur in between
9) In 100.00% of traces in the log, Each time A_DECLINED occurs, it is preceded by A_SUBMITTED and no other A_DECLINED can recur in between
10) In 100.00% of traces in the log, Each time A_DECLINED occurs, it is preceded by A_PARTLYSUBMITTED and no other A_DECLINED can recur in between
11) In 100.00% of traces in the log, Each time A_PREACCEPTED occurs, it is preceded by A_SUBMITTED and no other A_PREACCEPTED can recur in between
